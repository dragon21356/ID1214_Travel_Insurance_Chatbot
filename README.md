Place the .csv file and the Python script in the same folder.
Open a terminal or command prompt in that folder.
Run the chatbot using the command "python chatbot.py" or simply run from within your respective IDE

Upload the Data File:
When prompted, upload the .csv file containing the travel insurance data that we have provided or your own one that has been formatted
specifically.

Type your query into the console. 

Examples of queries include:

In case you stumble into some errors, here are a couple troubleshooting steps:

4. Troubleshooting

a. The chatbot doesn't start.
Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed.
Check for syntax errors if the script was modified.

Some answers to questions that you may have

5. FAQ

Can I update the data?
Yes! Simply add your updated values and replace the .csv file. Then restart the chatbot and follow the steps from earlier.

What happens if my query isnâ€™t understood?
This may occur due to T5's limited usability but if it does, the chatbot will prompt you to clarify your question.

Is my data secure?
The chatbot does not permanently store any user data or queries and is run completely locally with an option to share a secure link
to any of your trusted friends, therefore guaranteeing security

6. Additional Notes

a. Ensure the column names in the .csv file match the expected format exactly.

b. The chatbot is designed for single-user sessions. Restart the script to reset the chatbot.
